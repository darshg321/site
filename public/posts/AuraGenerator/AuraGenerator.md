## What is Aura Generator?

Aura Generator is an attachment to your shoe, or anywhere on your body for that matter, to generate mist, yielding you
as much aura as you desire. The idea came to me from thinking about stage smoke effects for announcers, and I had
recently also seen a mist generating module that I thought was pretty cool, leading to the creation of this.

## How It Works

It is powered by a 5V ultrasonic atomizer module; the module works by vibrating hundreds of thousands of times a second,
and while covered in water, this creates mist. I used two modules, a total of three atomizers as they were from boards
that can connect different amounts of atomizers at once. For power, I simply connected each module to a battery to usb-c
bank, lasting plenty of time. Because the modules need to be constantly covered with water, I used the provided cotton
tubes to store water for quite a while (> 30 mins) without the modules drying out, refilling by simply dipping them in
water once they were dry. I taped both modules to my shoe, something quite unfortunate as the combination of walking
and low quality tape made it come off near instantly, and so I mostly just kept it on my hat.

## Conclusion

There is a million cool and cheap modules that you can make projects out of if you just look hard enough, and I aim to
find many more to use.
